Hello, I'm Sanghyun Lee.

I'm a software engineer from South Korea and living in Berlin now.

I've been working on topics like frontend, backend, distributed system, and data.

I use [Scala](https://github.com/Sangdol/scala-test-driven-learning) and [Python](https://github.com/Sangdol/python-test-driven-learning) these days and used to use [Java](https://github.com/Sangdol/java-test-driven-learning) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/Sangdol/node-test-driven-learning).

I like writing tools for myself and this web site is built by [a custom static site generator](https://github.com/sangdol/bluecheese) written in [Clojure](https://github.com/Sangdol/clojure-test-driven-learning).

I spend hours to automate things with [Vimscript](https://github.com/Sangdol/vimscript-test-driven-learning), [Lua](https://github.com/Sangdol/lua-test-driven-learning) (and [Hammerspoon](https://github.com/Sangdol/hammerspoon-config)), bash, zsh, and fish script, and save seconds every day.

I use [nvim](https://github.com/Sangdol/vimrc), IntelliJ, and iTerm2 to write code with a MacBook.
