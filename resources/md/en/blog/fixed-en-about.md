Hello, I'm Sanghyun Lee.

I'm a software engineer from South Korea and live in Germany now.

I've worked on frontend, backend, distributed systems, and data-related topics.

I use [Python](https://github.com/Sangdol/python-test-driven-learning), and I used [Java](https://github.com/Sangdol/java-test-driven-learning), [JavaScript](https://github.com/Sangdol/node-test-driven-learning), and [Scala](https://github.com/Sangdol/scala-test-driven-learning) before.

This website is built by [a custom static site generator](https://github.com/sangdol/bluecheese) written in [Clojure](https://github.com/Sangdol/clojure-test-driven-learning).

I enjoy automating things with [Vimscript](https://github.com/Sangdol/vimscript-test-driven-learning), [Lua](https://github.com/Sangdol/lua-test-driven-learning) (and [Hammerspoon](https://github.com/Sangdol/hammerspoon-config)), bash/zsh/fish scripts, Alfred, and a Raspberry Pi.

I use [nvim](https://github.com/Sangdol/vimrc) and iTerm2 with a MacBook to write code.

Drop me an email at hammerha@gmail.com if you have any questions or feedback.
